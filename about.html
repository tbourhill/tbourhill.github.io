        And no I’m not Australian or a New Zealander. My lovely accent is from South Africa. I am
        a scientific writer and I spend my time creating engaging and innovative content for a
        company called MaxCyte® . In geek speak I currently specialize in cell and gene therapy
        specifically focused on electroporation, cancer and immunotherapy. How did I transition
        from being a molecular biologist into science communication well that’s a twisting tale...

        I have always been interested in the idea that viruses, normally the bad guys in any biological
        story, can be used to treat disease. During my Masters, I built a new virus that was designed
        to treat Hepatitis C. Once I finished that project, I was intrigued by the idea that naturally
        occurring viruses could be used to treat cancer. So I followed my passion all the way across
        the world to Canada where I started a PhD.

        I started realizing how important science communication was when I first tried explaining my
        work to my close family and friends. This was an evolving process as my Masters and PhD
        interests differed quite substantially. I was constantly explaining new fields, experiments and
        discoveries, all of which I was still learning about myself, to my parents and my husband.

        I believe scientists have a responsibility to help the public understand their discoveries in a
        way that is easy to grasp. This is what has driven my passion for reading and writing about
        the field. I love transforming complicated ideas into approachable and engaging
        conversations. Science should be accessible to everyone and I’m here to help with that!
